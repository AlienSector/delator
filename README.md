DELATOR (*lat.* **informer**) is a tool to perform subdomain enumeration through the abusing of certificate transparency logs. It expands on the original work done by [Sheila A. Berta](https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek) with her [CTFR](https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek/ctfr) tool and leverages the speed and power of [Go](https://golang.org/).

Using DELATOR is as simple as running:

**DELATOR is under active development** so do make sure you check back frequently for new releases.
