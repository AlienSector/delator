Delator (*lat.* **informer**) is a tool to perform subdomain enumeration through abusing certificate transparency logs. It expands on the original work done by [Sheila A. Berta](https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek) with her [CTFR](https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek/ctfr) tool and leverages the speed and power of [Go](https://golang.org/). Delator is work in progress and V.1 is due for release **very** soon ... so do make sure to check back frequently.
